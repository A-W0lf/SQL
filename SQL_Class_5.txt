--- Write a query to print the name of department along with the total salary paid in each department
--- Normal approach
select d.dept_name, tmp.total_salary
from (select dept_id , sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id) tmp
inner join department d on tmp.dept_id = d.dept_id;

--- how to do it using with clause??
with dept_wise_salary as (select dept_id , sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id)

select d.dept_name, tmp.total_salary
from dept_wise_salary tmp
inner join department d on tmp.dept_id = d.dept_id;

with dept_wise_salary as (select dept_id , sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id), 
dept_wise_max_salary as (select dept_id , max(salary) as max_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id)

select * from dept_wise_max_salary;

select * from dept_wise_salary;
